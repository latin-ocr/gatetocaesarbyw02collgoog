-000—

lunaonucroau Nona-To unuslaoe Latin into English is to express
themeaningoithelatlulnEuglishwordsandlnthelluglishidiom. Butthe
meaning must ba discovered batere it nan ba expressed. Dlsoovering the
sense is, therefore, a process prepuratory to translation, but yet measurably
dlstinot from it. For disoovering the meaning, the golden rule is, Toka
words ond clausas tn tle order in waiet they stand 11 the ilrst chapter
oi thIs book wera rendered luto English words exaotly iu the Latlu order,
the thought would be readily apprehended by any one quite unaoquaimed
with Latln. Such a word for word rendering, mental or oral, ls ior the
baginner a necessary preliminary to translation, but, 1 repeat, must not be
ooniounded with translation. For that, the goldan rula is, Expreas tlte
slusam in pure Enplist, without admistura os Latin idiom.
