PREFAOE.

-οοο-

Tne reeent discovery of a work of Aristotle has inter-
ested and delighted the whole learned world; but one may
venture to say that if, instead, a book had been found
written ιη the best periodos the Latin lauguage for the
amusement or instruotion of youth, by some Roman De
Foe, or Goldsmith, or hamb, or Bnrnett‚ there would be ten
times the reason for rejoioing. Unhappily there is no
likelihood that we shall ever congratulate ourselves on

suoh a “find’' for probably no snoh work ever existed
What a misfortune that it did uot ooeur to Oieero to divort

himself in some leisure hour by writing a story for Roman
youthl Millions of boys and girls iu these later ages would
have had good reason to blesa his name. Oaesar oouid have
done it; but to him, too, the gods denied suoh au inspiration,
and we must suffer for it. Seeing that he had eomposed a
treatise on Latin Grnmmar, one almost wonders that a mind
so original and fertile should not have eouoeived the idea
ol adapting his Gallio War, or some part of it, to the
powers and eomprehension of youth. What measureless
gratitudo would he not have won from unborn generations
of sehoolmasters, who have now to struggle desperately and
often unavailingly to make clear to their pupils the meaning
of his intricate periods, and untwist the stronde of his

knotty syntaxi
