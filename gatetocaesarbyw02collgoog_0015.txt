NOTE ΟΝ 'riis USE OF THE BOOK.

'ihc Simpiified Text and the Exercises based upon it 111 11 the
first importance. ’111111111111 translation 11 the 1111111111, followed
by the writing 11 them, will illustrate and help to impiant iu the
memory the 11111 important principles 11 syntax met with 11 ths text.
111 the teacher insist upon thorough work here, aud he may saiciy
omit other syntectical instruction.

But little power 11 reading Latin can be gained without making
the acquisitiou 11 awcrlriug voeabulary 1 distinct object. ‘ihc Latin
synonyme and the Etymclogieal Vocabulary may be made 111111
agents to that eud. 11 the words added to each chapter 111 read
aloud, reviewed, aud compared where baolrwaui references 111 made,
the ieamer will acquire 1 111111 111111 11 synonyms easily, naturally,
and with small expenditure 11 time. .

Itis 11111 111111 to retain in mind 1 number 11 words, grouped
according to some principle 11 similarity or certmst, thau 1 single
word with nothing to hoolr it to the memory. For this reason it is
recommended that the Etymological Vocabulary be 11111 pressed into
Α the service. Suppose, 111 example, the word conspectas occurs iu the
lesson. 11 the teacher will turn to page 138 and hare the teu words
read out under the root SPEC, he will multiply several times the
chauces that this particular word will bs remembered 11 111 next
1111111111. Η1 will have douc much more. He will have increased
the chauces that nine other words will be lodged in the memory3 aud
to each one a fresh interest will be added by 111 being 1111 iu relation,
1111111111111111, aud therefore barren, 1111.

The first voeabulary may be used 111 comparing in the text the
different meanings aud uses 11 the same word. lt is through such
comparisous that oue gets at the heart and spirit 11 the lauguag'e,
while cultivatiug at the same time a mental habit 11 great value.

Having read the Simpiifled Text, the learner should bc well equipped
ior wrestling with the difficulties that remain 11 the uuchanged text,
111 he is already familiar with the thought and the lauguage. Com·
parison 11 the two texts by the teacher, so 111 as time permits, may
now be made to illustrate important principles, 11 11 indirect 1111111111,
which are here and there discussed iu the notes.
