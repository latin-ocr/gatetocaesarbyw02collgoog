PREFACE. V

and skill; we should take it, ii possible, aperto latere. We
should not begin with a difficult work; or if, in the dearth
of Latin suited to the juvenile mind, this is deemed nnavoid-

Caesar knew how to write his own language well; but he
wrote for men, he wrote with compression and in haste, and

For my part I confess‘that I sometimes find him obscure.
Moreover, when I am in doubt as to his meaning and appeal
to the oommentators,I find that they generally disagree and
sometimes quarrel about the sense. Therefore to put young
learners to reading (laesar as his text stando, bristling with
difficulties, before they have aequired anything more than a
meagre voeabulary and gained a modicum of insight by some
praetioe in reading easier Latin, is to set them at a task
harder than that whioh Pharaoh set the Israelites.

Iam oi the opinion that, even when a fair working voeabu-

’ lary has been aequired through some previous reading, there

is no book of the Gallio War that does not require a certain
degree of simplification to bring it to the level of the powers
of young boys and girls. It is this conviation born of long
observation oi the vexation of spirit, disoouragement‚ and
waste of time by pupils in wrestling with difficulties that
