Caesar is a difficult author. Some parts 01 his Gallic War
are as hard, or nearly as hard, as any prose Latin that has
come down to us. Yet it has somehow strangely enough
become the fashion to read that work first in a Latin course.

My own conviction is that for young learners a year's read· l

ing in easier Latin is not too much before taking up the
less difficult books of the Gallio War. Even then the

transition to (laesar comes with something 01 a shock; for ¹

the learner is soon and often brought face to face with
sentences that seem to him 01 most bewildering intricacy,

however they may, as commentatore sometimes remark,
¹ beautifully illustrate most important principles 01 Latin
order and construction. There isa sentence iu the second
book, by no means the most difficult one to be found, that
extends through eighteen lines—that is, something more
than half a page-containing twentyone distinct ideas,
and having the verb separated from its subject by ninety-
fcur words.

I know no more disheartening task than that 01 under-
taking to carry a class unprepared in age and knowledge
01 the language through Oaesar's Gallio War. Yet it is pre·
cisely this disheartening task that thousands 01 teachers- are
set to do, or set themselves to do, every year. The results
are often dismal enough. Teachers are blamed, they blame
themselves, they blame their pupils. Pupils may sometimes
be stupid, toachers may lack knowledge 01 the language
and the subject, but the fault may also lie wholly with the
author or with the Latin language itself 3 11 with the latter,
there is no help. Latin, it must be confessed, is an 0000011-
ingly difficult language to learn. All the more reason then
why, iu attacking it, every unnecessary obstacle should be
removed. We should make our approaches with cantion
