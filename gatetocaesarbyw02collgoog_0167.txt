HE editor believes that the poems of Ovid are, as regards both
style and subject-matter, adrnirably adapted to serve as an
introduction to the study of Latin Poetry. He has therefore fur·
nished the book with copious notes suited ιο tbe needs of young
studente, supplemented with grammatical references andan intro-
ductiou on the life and werke of Ovid, and on mythology.

The selections were chosen with a view ιο making the study oi
Latin interesting. Most of thern are from the Metamorphoses, of
which about onethird hasbeen taken. By help oi the argument,
which is given in full, tbe editor has endeavored not merely to
show the connection oi the tales and the ingenuity of the transi·
tiens—necessary ιο comprehend the poem as a whole-but to
put before the reader something like a complete picture of the
Greek mythology, at least of those narratives which have held
their permanent place in the modern mind and have entered more
or less into every modern literature.

The first eighty-eight lines oi Book I. have been omitted because
of their difficulty and lack of interest. From the Fasti three seleo-
tione are given3 from the Heroides, one3 from the Amores, three;
from the Tristia, five; and of the letters from Pontus, one. Special
carebas been taken to preserve the more interesting biographioal
hints of the lesser poema.

Professor Greenough‘s vocabulary, similar in style and character
ιο his Caesar, Cicero, and Virgil vocabularies, will doubtlessbe ready
before the autumn oi 1891. In the meantime Allen's Lexicon
will fill its place.
