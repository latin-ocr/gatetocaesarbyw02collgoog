NOW that the Beginner’s Latin Book has been before the public

nearly five years, the publishers 010 able 10 say without hesita-
tion that it has been 101 more successful than any other introduc
tory Latin book ever published 10 this country. This remarkable
10001110 due to 0 combination 01 excellences so skilfully blended

that 0110010 010 more patent than causes. While the book may be ·

used 00 00 introducticn 10 Caesar, it 10 01010 than this-it 10 00
introduction to Latin as 0 language. It prepares the student not
only to begin the study 01 (iasar, but, with proper gnidance, 10
make remarkably rapid aad satisfactory propress in reading and
understanding Latin. The skill 01 the authors as teachers has
enabled thom to secure these larger results without deviation from
the main line or increase 01 difficulties. The fundamental idea was
10 combine the utmost practice with the minimum 01 theory, on
the principle that a thorough acquisition 01 the elements 01 Latin
by the young 1001001 must be more a process than a 00101100, more
the work 01 observation, comparison, and imitation than the me·
chanical following 01 rules 01 the exercise 01 aualysis and conscious
inductire reasoning. There 010 therefore abundant and varied
exeroises on the forms and more important constructione 01 the
language. The 01111101 choice 01 words has made it possible 10
provide exercises that are in themselves interesting. The colloquia
(simple Latin dialogues), the extracta 101 translation, introduced
00 early 00 possible, and 1110 modo 01 treatment throughout are
made to impart 01110011100000, 1100110000, and variety, though there
is no sacrifice 01 rigorous scientific method. Even if the time
allowed 101 Latin the first year 10 quite limited‚ teachers may still
be able to carry classes through the book by omitting certain de·
taehable portione of the course. Provisicn 1100 been made 101 the
practical use 01 Latin in 0101 teaching.

Note 'the testimony 01 those who have used 11.
