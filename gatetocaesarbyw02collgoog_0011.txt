inevitably floor them, that has prompted me 10 put my 'y

hand 10 this work, which, slight as it may seem, has cost me ¹

the leisure 01 many mouths. But I shall feel repaid ten·
fold, if, through this little book, boys and girls are enabled
10 read Caesar with less waste of time, more easily, with
fresher interest, and added sense of power; if, in other
words, it proves in reality what it is in name, a Gate 10
basar.

Δ few words will be sufficient to explain the principle on

which I have simplified Caesada text, the amount of excision, ’
andtho degree of change. It would have been a compara· ¹

tively easy task to simplify the text hythe mere process .
of'omission, never deviating from the ipsissimo verba of the

author by so much as the change 01 0 mode or tense. Oue , ¹

could do this and still string together the disjecta membra

of the text into something like 0 connected narrative. But Ι ,

11101 would be 10 preserve the integrity 01 the words at the

expense 01 everytbing else,-inner relation, structure, style, ’

spirit. Orthe simplification might be effected by a virtual
rewritiug ot the text, by amplification rather than suppres-
sion, coupled with changes in the collocationes words,
where the arrangement seemed tc obscure the meaning and
perplex the learner.

My purpose and plan differed essentially from both these
methods. My aim has been, first, to keep the narrative in·
tact3 second, to retain as much ot the text as was consistent
with the effert to disburden it of its greater difficulties3
third, to make the fewest practicable changes in what was
retained, these, I believe, being almost entirely limited 10
modification of verb forms with the necessary concomitant
alterations3 fourth, very rarely to change the position cf a
word; finally, never to insert 0 word, except¹ occasionally
