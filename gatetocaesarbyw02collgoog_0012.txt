to supply a form plainly understood, or to introduce some
connective‚ like et, tom, doque, amem.

Aa to the amount oi excision‚ I find that Ι have omitted
almost exactly onefiith of (laesar’s text.

If the beginner in Caesar reads the simplified text and
concurrently turns the Exercises into Latin41aying firm
hold of the grammatical principles selected for illustration‚
I believe he will find the remaining difficulties of the origi-
nal text not beyond his scope. I should even hope that
he would then read with something of the joy of conscious
power. Ii the reading uf the texts and the writing of the
Exereises should require more time than is usually spent
on the second book of Caesar, which, however, I doubt, Ι
believe subsequent progress would still be rapid and satis·
factor-y enough to amount to a net gain and saving of time.

It has seemed best to mark long vowels, except the
vowels of final syllables and of monosyllables, the rules for
which can be readily learned I have, however, marked a
few monosyllables, as a constant reminder to teachers who
find their old pronunciation clinging to certain words. We
used to say bis, sio, non, quin, hdo. These words, therefore,

' Ihave marked. On the other hand, one is in no danger of

saying di, hi, si, prb, ior old habit would not mislead.

I take pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to Mr.
Alfred d. Rolfe for several useful criticisms, and to Miss
Caroline Ober Stone for carefully reading the proci-sheets
as far as the vocabularies. To Mr. clarence W. Gleason Ι
arn specially indebted. But for his timely and genereus aid, ’
both in the correction of the proof and in the preparation
of the vocabularies, the publication of this book must have

been very considerably delayed
